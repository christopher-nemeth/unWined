# unWined
unWined is a fullstack mobile wine tracking app that I developed for my capstone project at Galvanize. It's current iteration is still a work in progress and it will continue to be my pet project moving forward. The most challening aspect of this project was to implement an unfamiliar technology, in this case, it was React Native.

## Technologies and Libraries
**Client**
- React Native
- React Native Base
- React Native Elements
- React Native Router FLux
- Expo Development Environment

**Server**
- Express
- Knex
- PostgreSQL
- Heroku for Deployment

## Challenges
- Learning React Native in less than 10 days was fairly challenging on it's on right.
- Working with expo can be difficult with the frequent crashes.
- Finding a straight forward navigation solution took some time, especially because I did not have time to learn and set up Redux.
- Figuring out how state and props was slightly different compared to ReactJS.

## Future Implementations
- Learn and incorpoate OAuth to have users.
- Add camera feature for users to take pictures of the wine they try.
- Incorporate a feed to see what your friends are drinking once there are users adding data to the database.
